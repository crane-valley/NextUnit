# Speed Comparison Results

**Status**: Benchmarks have not been run yet.

Run the benchmarks to generate results:

```bash
cd tools/speed-comparison/src/SpeedComparison.Runner
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

Or trigger the GitHub Actions workflow manually from the [Actions tab](../../actions/workflows/speed-comparison.yml).

## What Gets Measured

The benchmark system compares NextUnit against other popular .NET test frameworks (xUnit, NUnit, MSTest) using **200 identical tests**:

- **50 Simple Tests**: Basic assertions (Equal, True, False)
- **50 Parameterized Tests**: Data-driven tests (5 methods × 10 parameters each)
- **25 Lifecycle Tests**: Tests with setup/teardown hooks
- **25 Async Tests**: Async/await test methods
- **25 Complex Assertion Tests**: Collection, string, and numeric assertions
- **25 Parallel Tests**: Tests designed to run concurrently

## Metrics Collected

- ⏱️ **Execution Time**: Total time, median, average, per-test overhead
- 💾 **Memory Usage**: Peak working set during execution
- 🚀 **Throughput**: Tests per second
- 📊 **Relative Performance**: Compared to NextUnit baseline

All tests use shared logic to ensure fairness. See [README.md](../README.md) for methodology details.
